# website-fa-22-first-site

Create a basic full stack site that we talked about in out first meeting.
So that it's different than the exact example that I used in the meetings, we'll make a basic site that can act as a restaurant menu. (kind of like snackpass)
For the backend, you should have the following components:
1. main index.js file
2. food model
3. food router
4. food controller

we'll give each food the fields name and price

This api should be able to make POST requests to post data to the database and GET requests to get the data. 

For the front-end please make two pages (doesn't need css but feel free to make it nice looking if you want) with these endpoints:
/ display a table of all foods
/new form to submit a new food

Remember that after cloning this repo to make your own branch.

DM me on slack when you're done and push your branch onto this repo. DO NOT merge with main or create a PR, I'll go to your branch myself and check your code.

Let me know if you have any questions.
